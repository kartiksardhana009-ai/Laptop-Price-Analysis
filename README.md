# Laptop Price Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a laptop pricing dataset to uncover trends and factors that influence price using Python.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset
2. Cleaned missing values and corrected data types
3. Visualized:
   - Price vs Brand
   - Price vs RAM
   - Price vs Processor
4. Extracted insights from visual patterns

## 📍 Key Findings
- Laptops with **higher RAM and better processors** tend to have higher prices.
- Premium brands generally show **higher average prices** than budget brands.

## 🗂️ How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `laptop_price_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run cells to explore analysis and visuals

## 📸 Visuals (Optional)
